OOPs to design a program using classes and objects.

nothing but writing software the same way we deal with things in real life.



Each object has:

Properties/attributes (data) **(height, color, weight)**

Behaviors/methods (actions) (you talk, I listen, a fan rotates, AC cools)

In real life, everything around us is an object —

me, you, this table, chair, laptop, fan, AC…

We break a big problem into objects.
This is exactly why OOPS is used — to divide the system into clean, independent objects.
Writing simple programs is fine when the application is small.

Example:

A calculator program → addition, subtraction, multiplication = EASY.



But…



Problems start when applications grow bigger:

Banking System

Hospital Management

Food Delivery App

These involve thousands of features and millions of lines of code.



If we write everything in one place (procedural programming):



❌ Code becomes messy

❌ Hard to find bugs

❌ Hard to add new features

❌ Data leaks easily

❌ One small change breaks everything

❌ No reusability

❌ Team collaboration becomes impossible



OOPS solves ALL of these:



Teacher teaches

Teacher collects fees

Teacher prepares food

Teacher cleans classrooms











Read question

     ↓

Find inputs

     ↓

Find output

     ↓

Understand what to calculate

     ↓

Create formula/logic

     ↓

Test with sample inputs

     ↓

Write code































Teacher drives the bus

Teacher maintains attendance



We divide responsibilities:



Teachers → teach

Accountant → fees

Cook → food

Driver → transport



Each person does one job.

This makes school organized and manageable.

OOPS does exactly the same thing in programming.



Reusability (Write once, reuse many times)

Using inheritance, interfaces, classes.

Example:

Create a “Vehicle” class and reuse it for Car, Bike, Bus.
